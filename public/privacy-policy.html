              <h3 class="sub-heading">WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                <p> 
                    When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.                   
                    <h3 class="sub-heading">CONSENT</h3>
                    
                    How do you get my consent? <br>


                    When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. <br>
                    If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no. <br>


                    How do I withdraw my consent? <br>


                    If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at contact@srijan-nits.in <br>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">DISCLOSURE</h3>

                    


                    We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service. <br>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">PAYMENT</h3>

                    


                    We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved. <br>


                    Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. <br>
                    PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. <br>
                    For more insight, you may also want to read terms and conditions of razorpay on https://razorpay.com <br>

                    In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. <br>
                    However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. <br>


                    For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. <br>


                    In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. <br>


                    Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service. <br>
